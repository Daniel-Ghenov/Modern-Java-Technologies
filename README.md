Code developed for the Modern Java Technologies course I took in FMI Sofia University in 2024

Includes a working torrent, that can be used to: 
1. open .torrent files
2. connect to online trackers
3. Connect with peers
4. Simultaneously seed and leech to and from multiple peers
5. Correctly store downloaded torrents, and continue seeding them as long as the programme is running
